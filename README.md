# multi-user-json-serve-auth

This is a mock authentication system using json-server and json-server-auth npm libraries. \n
It provides the different roles to users who want to register and log into the system and stores their data in a JSON  file called users. \n
At the moment the users available are customer, guest and vendor but if you want to use the aps you can match it to whichever user types that suit you.
